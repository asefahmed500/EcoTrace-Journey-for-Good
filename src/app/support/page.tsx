    question: "How is the carbon footprint calculated?",
    answer: "Our calculations are based on standard emission factors for different modes of transport, vehicle types, and fuel sources. We combine this with real-time data from Google Maps for distance and duration, and our AI model adjusts for factors like traffic, weather, and public transit load to provide the most accurate estimate possible."
  },
  {
    question: "Is my personal data safe?",
    answer: "Yes. We prioritize your privacy. All personal data is encrypted, and we give you full control over your information. You can export or delete your data at any time. We do not sell your personal information to third parties."

    question: "How do I earn achievements?",
    answer: "Achievements are automatically awarded when you meet certain milestones, such as logging your first journey, using a new mode of transport, or traveling a specific total distance. You can view all your earned badges on your dashboard and profile."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I can't find a specific mode of transport?",
    answer: "We currently support driving, public transit, cycling, and walking. For driving, you can specify vehicle type (e.g., EV, hybrid, SUV) in the optional field for a more accurate calculation. We are always working on adding more options."
